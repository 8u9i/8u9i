## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi! I’m 8u9i — a curious coder, lifelong learner, and someone who genuinely enjoys building cool things with code.  
I believe in sharing knowledge, collaborating with others, and writing code that solves real problems (or sometimes just for fun!).

- 🌱 Always learning: tech, tools, and anything that sparks my curiosity.
- 🤝 Happy to connect, collaborate, or just chat about ideas.
- 💡 Motto: “Build with passion. Learn with humility.”

To personalize this and really make it “you,” could you share:
- Your profession or what you do (student, developer, etc.)?
- Your top skills or favorite tech?
- Any specific projects you want to highlight?
- Hobbies or interests outside of coding?
- Social links (LinkedIn, website, etc.)?
- Anything quirky or uniquely “you” to add (fun fact, motto, favorite quote)?

Your answers will help me tailor a README that truly reflects your personality!
