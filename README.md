## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi! I’m 8u9i — an ECE engineer at SQU and a passionate web developer.  
I love fixing issues, designing websites, and organizing things, all while keeping up to date with the latest in tech.  
I believe in sharing knowledge, collaborating with others, and writing code that solves real problems (or sometimes just for fun!).

- 🌱 Always learning: tech, tools, and anything that sparks my curiosity.
- 🤝 Happy to connect, collaborate, or just chat about ideas.
- 💡 Motto: “Build with passion. Learn with humility.”
- 🛠️ Favorite qoute: "من حسن إسلام المرء تركه ما لا يعنيه"
